    <div>Reserve a Computer Lab<br>
       <h3></h3> Some of our computer labs have classrooms that can be reserved for use by an academic class or training conferences. Classrooms can be reserved for individual dates or for the same time for multiple weeks in a semester. Due to high demand for semester long classes, we begin processing reservations for classrooms approximately 3 months in advance. We cannot accept reservations submitted less than 1 week in advance. It is very important to submit semester-long reservations as far in advance as possible.<br>
        
        Make a Reservation
        Lab classrooms are reserved online with our Reservation System. Due to the high volume of reservation requests we receive every semester, it is not feasible for us to process requests over the phone or via e-mail.<br>
        
        When you have decided which lab you wish to use, click on the "Request Courses and Sections" link in the main menu of the Reservation System. You can then request a lab for a particular semester, or on a day-by-day basis.<br>
         When you have completed your request you will receive a confirmation email from us when the lab has been officially reserved. If there are any problems we will contact you for more information.<br>

        
        Lab classrooms can be reserved for up to 2 hours per section request. If you require a lab for a longer period (a 6 hour conference, for example), you must make multiple sections. There is no limit to the number of sections a class can have, but the section names must be different.<br>
        
       <center><h1><u>Costs</u></h1></center><br>
        
        Academic courses and exams can reserve lab classrooms for free provided the lab is open, otherwise a $10/hour staffing fee will be charged.
        Lab classrooms can be be reserved for training purposes for $25/hour if the training is a non-commercial course for students or staff.
        Academic or University-affiliated conferences can reserve lab classrooms for $50/hour.</h3></div>

Remote access to campus computer labs will be open from 5am to 10pm every day. Hours between 10pm and 5am are reserved for computer maintenance and updates. <br> 

The "quick" steps below are for PC Windows users. For additional detailed instructions and steps for other devices & browsers (Chromebooks, Mac, etc.) please go to detailed instructions: Remote Access to Computer Lab Computers <br>

Quick steps for PC Windows users to access a computer remotely: 
Choose one of the college campuses below. 
Choose the specific computer lab you want to remote into (they are listed by building, room number and nickname).
Click on the specific computer to use. Computers that are available for use will appear on this list (computers already in use will not appear on this list).
A prompt to download a file will allow a connection to the specific computer.  Choose to run the file, following the prompts and accepting each dialog box.  Login using your MySeattleColleges Login (e.g. first.last@seattlecolleges.edu).    
Once the connection process is complete (this can take up to 2 minutes), you will see the same desktop screen and access the same software you would see if using the computer in person in the lab you chose. Mac users should click the "Windows"  menu from the "Microsoft Remote Desktop Client" and select "Fit to Window" to see the entire screen of the remote computer.
